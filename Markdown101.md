This file contains the getting started guide for beginner to start thier journey of mastering markdown files. We will be covering the basics of markdown files starting from headings, paragraphs, text formatting, links, images, list and finally tables.

Paragraph

This is how we normally type paragraph. But when it comes to line spacing between two seperate paragraphs we need a hard enter(one line in between) the para's else it will be inline.

Formatting Text : Bold and Italics

**This is bold, it is enclosed between double astricks(*) **

_This is italics, it is enclosed within a single underscore(_). _
